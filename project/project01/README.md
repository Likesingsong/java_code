    - **VariableExample.java**: Usage of different variable types.
    - **VariableExample1.java**: Examples of variable declarations and initializations.
    - **VariableExample2.java**: Additional examples of variable usage.
    - **VariableExample3.java**: Further examples of variable types and operations.
    - **VariableExample4.java**: More complex variable scenarios.
  - **exercises/**: Contains exercises for practical application.
    - **CircleAreaCalculator.java**: Calculates the area of circles based on given radii.
    - **TemperatureConverter.java**: Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
  - **controlflow/**: Demonstrates control flow structures in Java.
    - **IfElseExample.java**: If-else control flow structure.
    - **IfElseRewardExample.java**: Reward system based on scores.
